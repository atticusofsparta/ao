A computer can do math:

```

```
aos> 10 * 10
100
```

Sweet!

A computer can do characters:

```
aos> return "Hello"
Hello
```

A computer can do variables:

```
aos> a = "Hello"
aos> b = "World"
aos> return a .. " " .. b

```

Incredible!

A computer can do functions:

```
aos>.editor
function hello(name)
  return "Hello " .. name
end
.done

> NOTE: you can type `.editor` to enter multi line mode, then `.done` to submit.

Thats it for now, learn some lua and see what you can do with this computer... :)
